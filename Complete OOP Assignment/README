This is the final version of the semester long project we worked on in Object-Oriented Programming. We were tasked to design and implement a system to handle a previously undefined amount of grain tickets containing various properties such as weight, moisture content, etc, while using principles of OOP such as inheritance, polymorphic functions, and data encapsulation. We also created our own templated class and its functions, abstracted as a quasi-Linked List class. Due to time constraints for the semester, we were given the code in Array.i (the implementation file for the Array.h definition file), but we were also given general algorithms for the class in lecture, so it could've been recreated by me if enough time had been available.
