This program was for the Computer Systems Architecture course, and was part on a research paper for cache memory. While this isn't the final iteration of the program (the final one had the Chrono library from Boost added to it for more accurate timing as well as a function to more effectively clear the cache), it is a version containing all of my code. I also coded in some command line argument functionality as an excuse to play with that, since we had just talked about that in OOP around the time I wrote this.
